# How it started

When I started Advalls, I didnt know how to do UI design so the file Advalls.jpg is the first minimal UI design i created to have an idea. I created it in kolourpaint and even though it looks cartoonish, it gave me an idea of the UI and i didnt have to go through the hassle of learning figma or any other design software. 

# Note:
    This App is only made for Android as the app is made for mobile devices and neither did i have the resources not the intelligence to make this for IOS or any other platform. I may or may not port this to other platforms so dont keep any expectations. That's it. If you want to contribute and port this, you surely can. Just use "flutter create ." to recreate the files and do whatever you want.
